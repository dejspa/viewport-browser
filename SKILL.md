# Viewport Browser — Vision-First Web Navigation

You have access to a browser that lets you navigate websites, click elements, type text, and extract content. Everything is vision-based: you see screenshots and click by (x, y) pixel coordinates.

## Connection

The browser runs as an MCP server. Connect using one of these methods:

### Stdio (Claude Code, Cursor, local agents)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "viewport": {
      "command": "viewport-browser",
      "transport": "stdio"
    }
  }
}
```

### SSE / HTTP (OpenClaw, remote agents)

Start the server first, then connect:

```bash
# Start viewport-browser in SSE mode
viewport-browser sse
```

```bash
# OpenClaw
openclaw mcp set viewport '{"url":"http://localhost:8000/sse"}'
```

### Stdio with Python (if viewport-browser is not in PATH)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "viewport": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "viewport_browser.server"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Tools

| Tool | Parameters | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `navigate` | `url` | Go to a URL. If a tab with that domain is already open, switches to it. |
| `click` | `x`, `y` | Click at pixel coordinates on the screenshot. Auto-snaps to nearest interactive element. |
| `type_text` | `text`, `press_enter`, `clear_first` | Type into the currently focused element. |
| `scroll` | `direction` ("up"/"down") | Scroll the page. |
| `get_text` | — | Extract the page's main text content (articles, prices, product details). |
| `screenshot` | — | Take a fresh screenshot of the current page. |
| `go_back` | — | Browser back button. |
| `new_tab` | `url`, `pin` | Open a new tab. Set `pin="name"` to protect it from closing. |
| `switch_tab` | `index` | Switch to a tab by index. |
| `list_tabs` | — | Show all open tabs. |
| `close_tab` | `index` | Close a tab by index (cannot close pinned tabs). |

## How Clicking Works

1. Look at the screenshot and estimate the **(x, y) pixel coordinates** of what you want to click.
2. The screenshot is **~896 pixels wide** and **~630 pixels tall**.
3. Subtle **tick marks** along the top and left edges at **200px intervals** help you gauge position.
4. Your click is **automatically snapped** to the nearest interactive element (button, link, input).
5. After each click you get feedback like `Clicked: <button> 'Add to cart'` confirming what was hit.
6. To type into a field: **click its coordinates first** (to focus it), then use `type_text()`.
7. To search: click the search field, then `type_text(query, press_enter=true, clear_first=true)`.
8. Some actions return **text-only feedback** (no screenshot) when the page didn't visually change. Use `screenshot()` if you need to see the current state.

## Strategy Guide

### 1. SEARCH & ADD (e.g. "add product X to cart")
```
navigate → click search field → type_text(query, press_enter=true, clear_first=true) → screenshot → click "add" button
```

### 2. COMPARE & PICK (e.g. "find the cheapest X")
```
navigate → click search → type_text(query) → get_text (read ALL names and prices) → screenshot → click
```
ALWAYS use `get_text` first to read prices — don't guess prices from screenshots.

### 3. RESEARCH (e.g. "find info about X")
```
navigate → screenshot → get_text → report
```
Use `get_text` for article content — don't read long text from screenshots.

### 4. BROWSE FEED (e.g. "scroll through feed, find articles about X")
```
screenshot → scroll → screenshot → scroll (repeat)
```
Use `get_text` on interesting items.

## Important Behaviors

- If a **cookie banner**, ad interstitial, or overlay blocks the page, click its accept/dismiss/close button.
- **Popup tabs** (ads, new windows) are auto-closed.
- When comparing products: first filter to products that genuinely match the request, THEN pick cheapest among those. Think like a human — "milk" means regular milk, not oat milk.

## Rules

- Be efficient — never repeat the same action twice.
- Don't scroll unnecessarily — check what's already visible first.
- Don't open product detail pages when the info is already visible on the card.
- If an overlay or popup blocks you, take a new screenshot — it may have been auto-dismissed.
